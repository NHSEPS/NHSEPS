## Introduction ##

The DM+D API is an experimental API, aiming to find ways of making the rich information alreaday available in the NHS Dictionary of Medicines + Devices easier to use and maintain within modern applications and technologies.

## Purpose ##

The DM+D is an extension to the Snomed CT UK Drug extension which aims to provide information on most medications and medical devices available in UK primary care. It is a keystone of NHS interoperability, and already forms the heart of many national systems supporting care accross the UK. The API documented here aims to:

- Ease the burden of getting hold of the up to date data in a useful format.
- Make search and retrieval directly from an application fast and simple.

It does this by providing the data openly in a number of ready-to-use formats. It also provides a REST interface allowing search on any attribute, suggestions for partial input and delivering results including linked concepts.
